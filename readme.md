# Introduction
Patient-Doc is a web application that facilitates easy transactions between a patient and a physician. 
It allows for easy booking and rescheduling of appointments between a patient and physician. 
A patient can grant access to a physician via "release forms", in which only then a physician may view his/her medical records. 
However, if a patient schedules an appointment with a physician, the patient automatically grants access of his medical records to that physician.
